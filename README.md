### Background Story

You have accepted to challenge a friend to see whom of you
that can earn the most money in a month.
The rules you set up are simple; To prove how much money
you earn, you have to transfer your profits to a special
bank-account.

But you still have to make a living during this month
and therefore you can't move all of your cash to the bank.

---

You love cars and therefore you will now try to run your
own taxi/delivery service for the next month.
But you soon realise that the taxi- and delivery- business
is riskier than you first thought. Some people or goods you
drive come with a greater risk - and of course with bigger
profits!

How much are you willing to risk for some money?
Your car? *Your future career?* **YOUR LIFE?**

Should your business focus on risky but profitable missions or
stick to the ones that pay less but will give you a stable
income?
**It is time for you to get down to business!**
